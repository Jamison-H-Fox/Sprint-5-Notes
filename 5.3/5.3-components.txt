What is a component?
    - 'Single' modular pieces of code that can be reused
    - Made up of css, js, and html. Need all three to build a single component

Components are reusable and can help us keep code dry without repeating ourselves.

Components are usually stand-alone and agnostic to their context.
    - That means that once a component is built, it can work in different applications
